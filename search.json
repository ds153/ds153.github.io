The work involves developing predictive algorithms that learn from historical river stage information and nearby rainfall events from river and rainfall sensors. The derived insights in the form of correlated scores is then used as training sets for deep learning algorithms to accurately predict river stage information.\n","date":1533099600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533099600,"objectID":"80be3c9fcc86014efab0cec0f14957f6","permalink":"https://ds153.github.io/project/deep-learning/","publishdate":"2018-08-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/deep-learning/","section":"project","summary":"Predictive Analytics for Optimal Water Transportation","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"Deep Learning","type":"project"},{"authors":["David Sathiaraj","Xinbo Huang","Jianhua Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1531630800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531630800,"objectID":"3079e10cdf366a90126149a11fdc41cb","permalink":"https://ds153.github.io/publication/environmetrics/","publishdate":"2018-07-15T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/environmetrics/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Predicting climate types for the Continental United States using unsupervised clustering techniques","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D Sathiaraj","T Punkasem","F Wang","DPK Seedah"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1530680400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530680400,"objectID":"2f45606cda2cd734fce91c2536c8fbf5","permalink":"https://ds153.github.io/publication/wx_traffic_paper/","publishdate":"2018-07-04T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/wx_traffic_paper/","section":"publication","summary":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.","tags":[],"title":"Data-driven analysis on the effects of extreme weather elements on traffic volume in Atlanta, GA, USA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D Sathiaraj","WM Cassidy","E Rohli"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1512367200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512367200,"objectID":"e9d6d88a39494562d284e3551e0149f0","permalink":"https://ds153.github.io/publication/bigdata_elections/","publishdate":"2017-12-04T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bigdata_elections/","section":"publication","summary":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.","tags":[],"title":"Improving Predictive Accuracy in Elections","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Academic is a framework to help you create a beautiful website quickly.
